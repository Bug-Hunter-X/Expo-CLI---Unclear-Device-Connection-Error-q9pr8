This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run your app on a device or simulator that doesn't have the necessary permissions or configurations set up.  It can manifest in various ways, such as failing to connect to the device, encountering a timeout, or receiving vague error messages.  Often, the root cause is a mismatch between the development environment, the target device's OS, and the necessary Expo packages and dependencies.
